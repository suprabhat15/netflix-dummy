This codebase contains 4 components:-
1. App.jsx
2. Cards.jsx
3. Image.jsx
4. Sdata.jsx

Each component needs to be exported to the component where
it is to be used.

"""" function ncard(val){
    return ()
}
"""
Above mentioned function can be rewritten in lucid 
way using FAT ARROW.

const ncard = (val) =>{

}
Image.jsx contains {} while App.jsx contains ()--->
so there is confusion, Hence checkout thapa technical's
video to resolve this issue.
